      "question": "WHAT UTILITY DO METABAES OFFER?",
      "answer": "The first utility Metabaes provide holders is the chance at getting their Metabae featured/animated into our ongoing anime episodes as well as the manga comic series that we will begin producing once we sell 75% of the project. All holders will also have governance over what happens in each episode of both the anime and the comic. Along with these productions come many free airdrops. For example, if we kill a boss in an episode, all Metabae holders will get airdropped a plaque of the boss in a 3d NFT to serve as a commemoration of the event, these will also be tradable on marketplaces."

      "question": "WHAT OTHER UTILITIES DO METABAES OFFER HOLDERS?",
      "answer": "Holding a Metabae is a great financial decision as we will be setting up a pool of funds where a % of secondary market fees get deposited to. The funds in the pool will then be distributed equally to ALL metabae holders on a weekly basis. This means that if you HODL for long enough your Metabae may even end up being free. If the community proposes and votes on a new method of fee distribution amongst holders we will be happy to align with what our community prefers. The more Metabaes you hold, the larger your share of the pool!"

      "question": "ARE MY METABAES GOING TO THE MOON?",
      "answer": "Here are Metabaes HQ we understand how important market sentiment is and we will make sure to keep the secondary markets for Metabaes extremely healthy by creating another pool of funds this time from both the initial sale as well as secondary market fees. This pool will be used specifically for buying back the floor priced Metabaes on the secondary market on a WEEKLY basis. The Metabaes that are bought back from the secondary market by our team will either be used for future giveaways and promotions so that our project gains more attention or they will be thrown in a fire and burned in order to slowly deflate the available inventory of Metabaes on the market! Community will have the ability to vote on what we do with them every week!"

      "question": "WILL THERE BE A MINTING LIMIT?",
      "answer": "We are still deciding on whether we will implement a limit or not for minting! Our community will vote on a limit prior to the drop and will make the final decision."
